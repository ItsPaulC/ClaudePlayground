### RECOMMENDED: Create a new business with super-user
# See Business.http for the /api/businesses/with-user endpoint
# This is the recommended way to create a new tenant and its first user
# The business ID becomes the tenant ID

### Register a new user (no roles - regular user)
# NOTE: When registering, the user's tenantId will be their email (legacy behavior)
# For proper multi-tenant setup, use the Business creation endpoint instead
# Response includes: token, refreshToken, tenantId, email, firstName, lastName
# Use the tenantId in X-Tenant-Id header for subsequent API calls
POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Test123!",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}

### Register a super-user
# Super-users can:
# - Create businesses (cross-tenant)
# - Get all businesses (cross-tenant)
# - Update any business (cross-tenant)
# - Delete any business (cross-tenant)
# Roles are now objects with name, abbreviation, and value properties
POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "superuser@example.com",
  "password": "SuperUser123!",
  "firstName": "Super",
  "lastName": "User",
  "roles": [
    {
      "name": "Super User",
      "abbreviation": "SU",
      "value": "super-user"
    }
  ]
}

### Register an admin
# Admins can:
# - Update businesses only within their own tenant
# Roles are now objects with name, abbreviation, and value properties
POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "Admin123!",
  "firstName": "Admin",
  "lastName": "User",
  "roles": [
    {
      "name": "Administrator",
      "abbreviation": "ADM",
      "value": "admin"
    }
  ]
}

### Login with credentials
# Response includes: token, refreshToken, tenantId, email, firstName, lastName
# Use the tenantId in X-Tenant-Id header for subsequent API calls
POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Test123!"
}

### Get current user (requires authentication)
# Replace YOUR_JWT_TOKEN with the token from login response
GET https://localhost:5001/api/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

### Change password (requires authentication)
# Replace YOUR_JWT_TOKEN with the token from login response
POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/change-password
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "currentPassword": "Test123!",
  "newPassword": "NewTest456!"
}

### Refresh access token
# Replace YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN with the refreshToken from login/register response
POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refreshToken": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
}

### Example: Using TenantId in Business API calls
# After login/register, use the tenantId from the response in X-Tenant-Id header
# This ensures multi-tenant data isolation
GET https://localhost:5001/api/businesses
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_TENANT_ID
